in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).   

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, you'll need atleast :
 - Flutter 1.22.6 and 
 - Dart 2.10.5

Take care of the following steps and you'll be able to build [sample](https://github.com/argongs/complaintBox) soon enough :
 1. You can find installation instructions for Flutter SDK [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Dart comes along with the SDK, so there's no need for it's explicit installation. 
 2. Once you're done with the installation of the SDK, set up your editor (preferrably [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) as well (from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)).
 3. You can find the instruction to build an app in Android Studio [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio) and for VS Code [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code).
